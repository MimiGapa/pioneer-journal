# Pioneer Journal

Pioneer Journal is a digital repository for academic research papers organized by various educational strands. Designed to facilitate access to scholarly research, this project leverages modern web technologies to create a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly platform.

## Overview

Pioneer Journal consolidates research papers across multiple disciplines into a single, searchable interface. Built with a React frontend and an Express/Node.js backend, the project ensures efficient data handling and smooth user interaction. A robust metadata management system ensures that research details are consistently updated, minimizing manual synchronization efforts during development.

## History & Development

### **Project Initiation**  
The development of Pioneer Journal began with the setup of a structured GitHub repository to manage version control and collaboration efficiently. The repository was initialized using:

1. **Creating the GitHub Repository:**  
   - Set up the repository with an appropriate name and description.
   - Configured `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files like `node_modules`, build artifacts, logs, and editor-specific settings.
   - Established an MIT License file to clarify usage rights.

2. **Project Initialization:**  
   - Used `npm init` to scaffold the backend project structure.
   - Configured the frontend using Create React App (`npx create-react-app pioneer-journal`).
   - Established a logical folder structure, keeping the backend separate from the frontend.

### **Early Challenges & Solutions**
- **Metadata Synchronization:**  
  Initially, managing research paper metadata required manual copying, which became inefficient. A **symbolic link** was introduced in the `public` folder to reference the canonical `metadata.json` maintained in the backend (`pioneer-journal-server`), ensuring automatic updates.

- **Setting Up the Backend:**  
  The backend was built using Node.js and Express, designed to serve metadata and manage research entries dynamically.

- **Frontend Development & UI Optimization:**  
  The UI was designed for ease of navigation, with React components structured efficiently to allow filtering and searching across research papers.

## Features

- **Centralized Research Repository:** Aggregates research papers across diverse academic domains.
- **Dynamic Metadata Management:** Maintains a single source of truth via a symbolic link, ensuring updates propagate automatically.
- **Modern Web Architecture:** Uses React for a responsive frontend and Node.js/Express for a scalable backend.
- **Search & Filtering:** Allows users to quickly locate papers by keyword or metadata attributes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v14 or later
- npm (or yarn)
- GitHub for version control

## Setup and Installation

### **Cloning & Initializing the Repository**
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pioneer-journal
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### **Running the Development Server**
3. **Start the Backend:**
   ```bash
   node pioneer-journal-server/server.js
   ```
4. **Run the Frontend Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### **Build for Production**
5. **Compile & Optimize:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Project Structure

- **/src**  
  Contains the frontend React application, including components, assets, and styles.
  
- **/public**  
  Hosts static assets. A symbolic link (`metadata.json`) in this folder points to the authoritative metadata file in the backend.
  
- **/server.js**  
  The entry point for the Express backend.
  
- **/pioneer-journal-server**  
  Contains the definitive `metadata.json` and other backend logic, serving as the single source of truth for research metadata.

## Development Workflow

For local development, a symbolic link in the `public` directory references the authoritative metadata file located in the backend. This setup ensures that any modifications to metadata automatically reflect in the application without requiring manual updates.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, users can:
- **Browse Research Papers:**  
  View research entries sorted by academic strand, accessing detailed metadata.
- **Search & Filter Content:**  
  Use filtering tools to locate papers efficiently.
